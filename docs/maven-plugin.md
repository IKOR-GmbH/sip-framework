# SIP Maven Plugin

[TOC]

## Description
SIP maven plugin is additional tool used to enforce implementation of the most important SIP conventions.

## Goals Overview
The SIP plugin has a single goal:
 - `sip:connectors-cross-dependencies-check` - ensures that there are no cross dependencies (imports) between connector packages

## Usage
SIP plugin is configured on adapters generated by [sip-archetype](https://ikor-gmbh.github.io/sip-framework/archetype/).
To manually add it to SIP adapter (maven application with sip-starter-parent as a parent pom), you just need to provide 
the plugin in your pom: 

``` maven
<build>
...
    <plugins>
    ...
        <plugin>
            <groupId>de.ikor.sip.foundation</groupId>
            <artifactId>sip-maven-plugin</artifactId>
    </plugin>
```
In that case, the adapter will inherit following config from its parent:

``` maven
<build>
...
    <plugins>
    ...
        <plugin>
            <groupId>de.ikor.sip.foundation</groupId>
            <artifactId>sip-maven-plugin</artifactId>
            <version>${sip-framework.version}</version>
            <executions>
                <execution>
                    <goals>
                        <goal>connectors-cross-dependencies-check</goal>
                    </goals>
                </execution>
            </executions>
        </plugin>
```
